Printed parts should be 100% infill, PLA is adequate. All printed parts sized for Â¾" EMT tubing. Build files are included so bracket sockets can be resized parametrically for whatever material you have on hand. All parts should be secured with screws, after predrilling. Cut list for tube or dowel material is:
  - Risers: 2 x 400mm
  - Handle: 1 x 200mm
  - Braces: 2 x 150mm

Plans for the drilling pattern for the T-Loc cleats works for anything you would want to mount on a tool box or dust collector. T-Loc cleats can be printed with PLA, should have five or more wall/top/bottom layers with a medium density infill.
